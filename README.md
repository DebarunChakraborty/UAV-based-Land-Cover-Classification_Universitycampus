# UAV-based-Land-Cover-Classification_Tezpur_University_campus
In this project I intend to proposed a UAV image dataset of Tezpur University campus collected using DJI phantom 4 and pre-processed with Pix4Dmapper drone image propcessing software and explore the potential of Deep Learning models to classify the three area such as building, LowVeg and forest.
